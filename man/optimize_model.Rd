\usage{
optimize_model(
  df,
  response_cols,
  predictor_cols,
  glm_family = "binomial",
  autocorrelation_threshold = 0.8,
  automatic_removal = FALSE,
  round_p = 5,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A (wide) dataframe with predictors and response as columns}

\item{response_cols}{A list of response columns sorted by their relevance (most to least)}

\item{predictor_cols}{A list of predictors sorted by their relevance (most to least)}

\item{glm_family}{The family used for glm calculation}

\item{autocorrelation_threshold}{The threshold deciding (together with the p-values) whether two variables are autocorrelated}

\item{automatic_removal}{Whether to automatically remove autocorrelations}

\item{round_p}{Convenience parameter for automatic rounding of p-values}

\item{plot}{Whether to plot correlations for predictors with significant impact}

\item{aic_bic}{Whether to apply AIC and BIC difference in addition to ANOVA to determine if model is better/worse than ancestor}

\item{correlation_method}{The method used for correlation calculation}
}
\value{
An edited list of coefficients where autocorrelated variables are removed (according to sorted list of coefficients)
}
\description{
Optimize model by removing autocorrelations and variables that do not signicantly predict response variable
}
