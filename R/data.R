#' A dataset containing the traits of 220
#'  plant populations. The variables are as follows:
#'
#' @format A data frame with 220 rows and 13 variables:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item population_id: the official population identifier
#'   \item ploidy_level: the number of entire sets of chromosomes in a cell
#'   \item sexual_seed_perc: the percent of sexual to all formed seeds averaged across all flowers within the population
#'   \item sexual_seed_prop: the ratio of sexual to all formed seeds averaged across all flowers within the population
#'   \item altitude: meters above sea level
#'   \item latitude_gps_n: latitude coordinate of the measurement location (Northern Hemisphere)
#'   \item longitude_gps_e: longitude coordinate of the measurement location (Eastern Hemisphere)
#'   \item solar_radiation: amount of incoming solar radiation at the location (kJ/m^-2/day^-1; see BioClim database)
#'   \item habitat: description of the environment where the measurement was taken (e.g., forest, meadow, swamp; see BioClim database)
#'   \item number_flower_leaves: number of flower or floral leaves of a plant
#'   \item annual_mean_temperature: annual mean temperature at the location (see 'Bio1' in BioClim database)
#'   \item isothermality: ratio of mean diurnal range divided by temperature annual range (see 'Bio3' in BioClim database)
